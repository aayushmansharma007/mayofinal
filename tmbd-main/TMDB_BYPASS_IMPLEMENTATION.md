# TMDB Bypass Implementation for India

## Overview
This implementation provides multiple methods to bypass TMDB (The Movie Database) restrictions in India without requiring a VPN. The solution includes automatic fallback mechanisms and real-time status monitoring.

## Bypass Methods Implemented

### 1. Header Spoofing & Request Modification
- **User Agent Rotation**: Randomly rotates between different browser user agents
- **IP Spoofing**: Uses `X-Forwarded-For` and `X-Real-IP` headers to appear from US
- **Cloudflare Headers**: Spoofs `CF-IPCountry` to appear as US traffic
- **Additional Headers**: Includes various browser headers to mimic legitimate requests

### 2. Alternative Endpoints
- **Multiple TMDB Mirrors**: Tries different TMDB API endpoints
- **Fallback URLs**: Includes backup API servers
- **Endpoint Rotation**: Automatically switches between available endpoints

### 3. Proxy Server Integration
- **CORS Proxies**: Uses multiple CORS proxy services
- **Public Proxies**: Integrates with free proxy services
- **Proxy Rotation**: Automatically tries different proxy servers

### 4. DNS-Based Bypass
- **DNS Instructions**: Provides detailed DNS change instructions
- **Recommended DNS Servers**:
  - Google DNS: 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4
  - Cloudflare DNS: 1.1.1.1, 1.0.0.1
  - OpenDNS: 208.67.222.222, 208.67.220.220
  - Quad9: 9.9.9.9, 149.112.112.112

## Implementation Details

### Enhanced Fetch Function
The `rateLimitedFetch` function now includes 5 bypass methods:

1. **Method 1**: Direct request with spoofed headers
2. **Method 2**: Alternative TMDB endpoints
3. **Method 3**: Proxy server requests
4. **Method 4**: CORS proxy requests
5. **Method 5**: Fallback to original URL

### Bypass Status Monitoring
- **Real-time Status**: Shows current bypass method being used
- **Success Tracking**: Monitors successful and failed attempts
- **Block Detection**: Automatically detects if TMDB is blocked
- **Visual Indicator**: Color-coded status indicator in the UI

### User Interface
- **BypassStatus Component**: Shows current connection status
- **DNS Instructions**: Provides step-by-step DNS change guide
- **Status Colors**:
  - ðŸŸ¢ Green: Working (successful connection)
  - ðŸŸ¡ Yellow: Testing connection
  - ðŸ”´ Red: Blocked (try DNS change)

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/services/tmdbApi.js`
- Added bypass methods configuration
- Enhanced `rateLimitedFetch` function with 5 bypass methods
- Added status tracking and monitoring
- Included DNS bypass instructions

### 2. `src/components/BypassStatus.js` (New)
- Real-time bypass status indicator
- DNS change instructions
- Visual feedback for connection status
- Mobile-responsive design

### 3. `src/App.js`
- Integrated BypassStatus component
- Added bypass status monitoring

### 4. `src/MobileApp.js`
- Integrated BypassStatus component for mobile
- Mobile-optimized bypass status display

## Usage Instructions

### Automatic Bypass
The bypass methods work automatically. The app will:
1. Try the first method (spoofed headers)
2. If that fails, try alternative endpoints
3. If that fails, try proxy servers
4. If that fails, try CORS proxies
5. If all fail, show DNS change instructions

### Manual DNS Change (Recommended)
For best results, users can manually change their DNS settings:

#### Windows:
1. Control Panel > Network and Internet > Network Connections
2. Right-click your connection > Properties
3. Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) > Properties
4. Use the following DNS server addresses:
   - Primary: 8.8.8.8
   - Secondary: 8.8.4.4

#### Mac:
1. System Preferences > Network > Advanced > DNS
2. Add DNS servers: 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4

#### Android:
1. Settings > Wi-Fi > Long press your network
2. Modify network > Advanced options
3. IP settings > Static > DNS 1: 8.8.8.8, DNS 2: 8.8.4.4

#### iOS:
1. Settings > Wi-Fi > (i) next to your network
2. Configure DNS > Manual
3. Add servers: 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4

## Technical Features

### Caching
- 5-minute cache for successful API responses
- Reduces API calls and improves performance
- Bypass method results are cached

### Error Handling
- Graceful fallback between methods
- Detailed error logging
- User-friendly error messages

### Performance
- Parallel request attempts where possible
- Optimized proxy selection
- Minimal impact on app performance

## Security Considerations

### Data Privacy
- No user data is sent to proxy servers
- Only API requests are proxied
- User credentials remain secure

### Proxy Safety
- Uses reputable proxy services
- Validates proxy responses
- Falls back to direct requests if proxies fail

## Monitoring & Debugging

### Console Logging
- Detailed logs for each bypass method
- Success/failure tracking
- Performance metrics

### Status API
- `getBypassStatus()`: Returns current bypass status
- `getBypassInstructions()`: Returns DNS change instructions
- Real-time status updates

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Smart Proxy Selection**: AI-based proxy selection
2. **Geographic Routing**: Route through different countries
3. **Protocol Switching**: HTTP/HTTPS/SOCKS proxy support
4. **Custom Proxy Integration**: User-defined proxy servers
5. **Bandwidth Optimization**: Compress requests for faster loading

### Maintenance
- Regular proxy server updates
- DNS server health monitoring
- Bypass method effectiveness tracking

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **All methods failing**: Try changing DNS settings
2. **Slow loading**: Some proxy servers may be slower
3. **Intermittent failures**: Normal behavior, app will retry automatically

### Support
- Check the bypass status indicator in the top-right corner
- Follow DNS change instructions if blocked
- Clear browser cache if issues persist

## Legal Notice
This implementation is for educational purposes and to provide access to publicly available APIs. Users should comply with local laws and regulations when using these bypass methods.
